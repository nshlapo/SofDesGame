##Gameplay
You are wanderer trying to escape a deadly maze.
You have no map, but you can recall the layout of any part of the maze you visit.
There is only one exit, marked by a **golden** wall, and there is one door you must unlock, represented by a **red** wall.
You can unlock the door by picking up the **blue** key, the only object whose location you know.

You must not be captured by the enemy, whose distance from you (as the crow flies) is shown by a red gauge on the side of the screen.
The enemy will follow you, and if you occupy the same position as the enemy, you will be caught.
To evade capture, you can place up to 3 **purple** traps, which will halt the enemy in their tracks, and prevent them from capturing you, for two turns.

Good Luck!
